# Safe Crackers

Dive into the world of fast-paced safecracking with Safe Crackers! Armed with nothing but your wits and a mysterious one-button gadget, you’ll spin, time, and crack your way through increasingly challenging safes whilst uncovering quirky treasures.

A single button stands between you and glory, are you ready to become the ultimate safecracker?

## Controls

X - that is all! Note - on some controllers this may map differently, on an xbox controller PICO's X key maps to B, for example.

## About

My submission to the 2024 1-Button Game Jam. Built using PICO-8. I had two goals in this jam:

- Improve my understanding of trigonometry in the context of game development; hence the circle based mechanics. 
 - Get more familiar with PICO-8:
    -Memory. Whilst I didn't end up doing anything too advanced in this game with memory, my research during the jam means I have a much better understanding of how PICO handles memory having used tools like Memsplore.
 - Graphics. early versions of this game had me playing around with patterns in PICO, inverting the fill pattern by poking the correct memory address and then bit-shifting the pattern in memory to emulate the feel of a rotating dial. Ultimately I couldn't get the effect I wanted so this never made it into production, but it was fun nonetheless!

I built out two modes (story & endless) as part of this, the story mode was an excuse for me to explore adding more "dials" onto the screen at any one time to see how this would work from a gameplay perspective.

I had a lot of fun with this jam and I learnt a lot, so I hope you enjoy playing!
